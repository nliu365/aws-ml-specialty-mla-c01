Here is how the sagemaker training/deploying/inference look like. This is just the whole workflow:

[2022-03-29_06-22-43-c41ed23bb1065a9de5f462a4efb1b66f.jpg](attachment:1158c4b2-3653-4981-9f25-864226fdb707:2022-03-29_06-22-43-c41ed23bb1065a9de5f462a4efb1b66f.jpg)

1. Training data which need preprocessing mainly labeling using AWS ground truth then the data is saved to S3 bucket and ready for training;

2. SageMaker load the data via S3 bucket address and split the data to training data and test data via training code;

3. SageMaker launch compute instance, pull training image from ECR and do training;

4. SageMaker will generate model artifact saving to S3 bucket;

*5. SageMaker creates inference image:*

*# - Takes your inference code*

*# - Packages it into Docker image*

*# - Pushes to ECR*

*# - This happens BEFORE deployment starts*

6. SageMaker deploys using the inference:

# launch compute instance

# pull inference image from ECR

# load model artifact from S3

# start inference service

*7. Endpoint is now hosting the model:*

*# - Ready to receive requests*

*# - Inference code running*

*# - Model loaded and ready*

Complete Architecture Flow:

```
Client → AWS Ground Truth → S3 Bucket (Training Data)

# 2. Training Job
SageMaker → ECR (Training Image) → Compute Instance → S3 (Load Data)
Your Training Code → Data Splitting → Model Training → S3 (Save Artifacts)

# 3. Deployment
SageMaker → ECR (Inference Image) → Compute Instance → S3 (Load Artifacts) → Endpoint

# 4. Inference
Client → Endpoint → Predictions
```

Think of it like this: Training image = "How to build a car", Inference image = "How to drive the car"!

In the Diagram:

```
# Left side (Training):
"Training code image" → "Model training" → "Model artifacts"

# Right side (Deployment):
"Inference code image" → "Deployment / hosting"

# The inference image is created BEFORE the deployment/hosting section
```

Q:'my training script' points to the training code in the pic?

A:

Summary

Yes, "my training script" = "Training code" in the image

- Training code = Your actual ML training logic
- Helper code = AWS utilities that support your training
- Both run together on the SageMaker compute instance
- Your script is the main logic, helper code provides AWS integration

So when I said "data splitting happens in your training code" - that means it happens in the "Training code" component shown in the image!

Q: what is the usage for "SageMaker creates inference image (separate from training)"? I mean what next step will use it?

A:

What is the Inference Image?

Inference Image = Code for Making Predictions

Why Separate Images?

Training Image vs Inference Image:

```
# Training Image:
# - Contains training libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
# - Contains data processing code
# - Contains training loop
# - Large size (many dependencies)

# Inference Image:
# - Contains only prediction code
# - Optimized for fast inference
# - Smaller size (fewer dependencies)
# - Optimized for serving requests
```

The Image Shows This Flow

In the Diagram:

```
# "Training code image" → "Model training" → "Model artifacts"
# "Inference code image" → "Deployment / hosting" → "Endpoint"

# The inference image is used in the "Deployment / hosting" section
# to serve the trained model for real-time predictions
```

Summary

The inference image is used for:

1. Deployment: SageMaker uses it to deploy the model to an endpoint
2. Serving: The endpoint uses it to handle real-time prediction requests
3. Optimization: It's optimized for fast inference, not training

Next steps that use it:

- Deploying the model to an endpoint
- Serving real-time predictions to clients
- Handling inference requests efficiently

Think of it like this: Training image = "How to build a car", Inference image = "How to drive the car"!

Q: does inference code aim to generate inference image or to process the client inference request?

A:

Summary

Inference code serves BOTH purposes:

1. Source Code: Used to generate the inference image
2. Runtime Process: Processes client inference requests

The flow:

Your Inference Code (Source)

↓

SageMaker Creates Inference Image (ECR)

↓

Inference Code Runs (Runtime) - Handles Client Requests

So the answer is: BOTH! Your inference code is used to create the image, and then that image runs your code to process client requests.

Think of it like: Your code is the recipe (source), the image is the packaged meal (container), and the running process is the restaurant serving customers (runtime)!

Q: when does this inference image generation happen? before or after or within deployment or before or after or within hosting?

A:

Summary

Inference image generation happens:

- BEFORE deployment starts
- BEFORE hosting begins
- AFTER training completes
- AFTER model artifacts are saved

The sequence:

```
Training → Model Artifacts → Inference Image Generation → Deployment → Hosting
```

Why this order: The inference image must exist in ECR before SageMaker can pull it during deployment. It's like having the recipe ready before you start cooking!

Think of it like: You need to build the car (inference image) before you can drive it (deployment/hosting)!
